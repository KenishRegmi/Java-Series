// Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
// Syntax: (function() { // function body })();
(function() {
    console.log("This is an IIFE");
})(); // IIFE is executed immediately after its definition

// Global scope pollution is avoided because variables and functions defined inside IIFE are not accessible outside
